README 03 NOV 2024 

### Brief explanation:
The `fig_1~3.py` are scripts used for generating plots, each corresponding to a specific figure number. The figures and captions are already displayed in the `README.md` file. Please download the project's zip file, extract it, and place it in the designated path to reproduce my work. You can directly view the figures here: [Fig 1](#fig-1), [Fig 2](#fig-2), and [Fig 3](#fig-3).
